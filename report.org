* STEADY  2D  - Convection  - Diffusion
The two-dimensional transport equation for temperature reads
\[\frac{\delta}{\delta x}(\rho U T) + \frac{\delta}{\delta y} (\rho V T)  = \frac{\delta}{\delta x} (\gamma \frac{\delta T}{\delta x}  ) + \frac{\delta}{\delta y} (\gamma \frac{\delta T}{\delta Y}) + S\]

where
\[ \gamma = \frac{\rho}{C_p} \]

* Simulation result with error tolerance of  error < 0.0001

* Sensitivity to Boundary Condition 
At East Boundary , except at outlet Temperature is fixed  at 50 degree
The Dirichlet conditon [T = 50 degree C]is applied at East Boundary except at the outlets which was previously set to [T = 20 degree C]

* Sensitivity to Convergence

** TDMA Convergence Test 
 | tolerance Value | 10.0 | 1.0 |  0.1 | 0.001 | 0.0001 | 1.0e-5 | 1.0e-6 | 1.0e-7 |
 | counter         |  nil | nil | 10.0 | 126.0 |  256.0 |  297.0 |  298.0 |  297.0 |

** Gauss-Siedel Convergence Test  

 | tolerance Value | 10.0 | 1.0 | 0.1 | 0.001 | 0.0001 | 1.0e-5 | 1.0e-6 | 1.0e-7 |
 | Counter         |  nil | nil |   4 |   133 |   1277 |  12865 |  17840 | 17840 |

 Comments : TDMA converges much faster for error tolerance 1e-7 297 iteration are performed for solution to converge , but for Gauss Siedel 17840 iteration are performed for same error tolerance
